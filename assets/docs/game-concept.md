# Game Concept: [Project Name]

## The Pitch
*One sentence. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it yet.*

> 

## Game Pillars (3-5 max)
*The core emotions/experiences your game delivers. Every feature must serve at least one pillar. If it doesn't, cut it.*

1. **[Pillar Name]**: [What the player feels/experiences]
2. **[Pillar Name]**: [What the player feels/experiences]
3. **[Pillar Name]**: [What the player feels/experiences]

### Pillar Test
For any proposed feature, ask: "Which pillar does this serve?" No answer = don't build it.

## Core Loop
*The 15-60 second cycle players repeat. This IS your game.*

```
[ACTION] → [FEEDBACK] → [REWARD] → [PROGRESSION] → back to ACTION
```

**Example formats:**
- Shooter: `Shoot → Kill → Loot → Upgrade → Shoot stronger enemies`
- Obby: `Jump → Land/Fall → Checkpoint → Harder section → Jump`
- Tycoon: `Earn → Buy → Unlock → Earn faster → Buy more`
- Horror: `Explore → Tension builds → Scare → Relief → Explore deeper`

**Your loop:**
```
[        ] → [        ] → [        ] → [        ] → loops
```

### Loop Validation
- [ ] Can someone understand this loop in under 30 seconds?
- [ ] Is the core action fun *before* any progression systems?
- [ ] Does each cycle feel meaningfully different from the last?

## Player Experience Goals
*How should players FEEL? Not what they DO, but the emotional response.*

| Moment | Target Emotion |
|--------|----------------|
| First 30 seconds | |
| Core gameplay | |
| After winning/completing | |
| Coming back next session | |

## Target Player
*Be specific. "Everyone" means no one.*

- **Age range**: 
- **Play session length**: 
- **Plays games like**: [2-3 specific titles]
- **Looking for**: [What need does your game fill?]

## Unique Hook
*Why play THIS instead of the 10 similar games already on Roblox?*

> 

## Inspirations
*Name-drop freely. "It's X meets Y" is fine.*

| Game | What to steal |
|------|---------------|

## Anti-Goals
*What this game is NOT. Equally important as what it is.*

- This is NOT a...
- We will NOT include...
- Players should NOT feel...

## MVP Definition
*The smallest playable thing that tests whether your core loop works.*

### Must Have (ship without these = not your game)
- 
-

### Should Have (makes it better, but loop works without)
- 
- 

### Won't Have (for this version—park these ideas)
-

## Open Questions
*What you don't know yet. Honest uncertainty > fake confidence.*
