# Roblox Monetization Guide

## The Economics (2025)

### DevEx Rates
- **Exchange rate**: $0.0038 per earned Robux (as of Sept 2025—8.5% increase from previous)
- **Platform cut**: Roblox takes ~30% of all transactions
- **Minimum cashout**: 30,000 Robux (~$114 USD)

### Real Math
When a player buys a 1,000 Robux game pass:
1. You receive ~700 Robux (after 30% platform fee)
2. At DevEx rate: 700 × $0.0038 = **$2.66 USD**

So a $9.99 Robux purchase that becomes a 1,000R game pass nets you ~$2.66.

### DevEx Requirements
- 13+ years old
- 30,000+ earned Robux minimum
- Active Roblox Premium subscription
- Verified email
- Good standing (no bans/violations)
- Tax forms completed (W-9 US, W-8 international)

## Monetization Methods

### 1. Game Passes
**What**: One-time permanent purchases
**Best for**: Major unlocks, cosmetics, VIP perks

**Examples:**
- VIP access (special areas, items)
- Double XP/coins
- Cosmetic bundles
- Remove ads
- Extra save slots

**Pricing psychology:**
- Anchor with a premium option (makes mid-tier look reasonable)
- Common tiers: 50, 150, 400, 1000 Robux
- Don't price below 25R—too cheap feels worthless

### 2. Developer Products
**What**: Consumable/repeatable purchases
**Best for**: Currency, boosts, revives

**Examples:**
- In-game currency packs
- Temporary boosts (2x coins for 30 min)
- Extra lives/revives
- Loot boxes/crates (careful with perception)
- Skip wait timers

**Warning**: Repeatable purchases can feel predatory if not balanced well. Kids play Roblox—design ethically.

### 3. Premium Payouts
**What**: You earn Robux based on Premium subscribers' time in your game
**Best for**: Passive income on engaging games

**How it works:**
- Roblox tracks Premium user playtime
- You get a share of their subscription proportional to time spent
- No action needed—just make an engaging game

**Optimizing:**
- Session length matters—keep players engaged longer
- Premium users are valuable—consider small perks for them
- This rewards retention over acquisition

### 4. Rewarded Video Ads
**What**: Players watch ads for in-game rewards
**Best for**: Games with consumable economies

**Implementation:**
- Player CHOOSES to watch (not forced)
- Reward must feel worthwhile
- Limited views per day prevents abuse
- Partnership with Google (as of 2024)

## Monetization Strategy

### The Free-to-Play Balance

```
Fun without paying ←——————————→ Pay-to-win
       ↑                              ↑
    Sweet spot                   Player resentment
```

**Guidelines:**
- Core loop must be fun without spending
- Paying = faster/easier/cosmetic, NOT required
- Time-rich players should have a path to everything
- Money-rich players can shortcut, not gatekeep

### What to Monetize

**Good targets:**
- Cosmetics (no gameplay advantage)
- Convenience (save time, not gain power)
- Customization (expression, not strength)
- Content access (more levels, not easier levels)

**Dangerous targets:**
- Power/stats (creates pay-to-win)
- Required progression (creates paywall)
- Competitive advantage (unfair to free players)
- Gambling mechanics (ethical and legal issues)

### Pricing Tiers

Typical structure:
| Tier | Price Range | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Impulse | 25-75 R | Low barrier, high volume |
| Standard | 100-400 R | Main revenue driver |
| Premium | 500-2000 R | Whales, completionists |
| Supporter | 2000+ R | Super fans, often cosmetic |

### When to Add Monetization

**Too early**: Players can't engage with purchases, feels cash-grabby
**Too late**: Retrofitting monetization is harder than building it in

**Sweet spot**: After core loop is fun but before you're "done"—monetization should enhance, not save, a game.

## Roblox-Specific Features

## Ethical Considerations

Roblox's audience skews young. Design monetization you'd be comfortable explaining to a parent.

**Red flags:**
- Mechanics that exploit FOMO (fear of missing out)
- Pressure to spend to keep up with friends
- Hiding true costs (multiple currency conversions)
- Targeting loss aversion ("you'll lose progress if...")
- Loot boxes with poor odds disclosure

**Green flags:**
- Clear value proposition
- No gameplay locked behind paywall
- Cosmetic-focused monetization
- Transparent pricing
- Respecting players' time AND money
