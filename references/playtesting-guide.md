# Playtesting Guide

## Why Playtest

Your core loop is not fun until players confirm it is. What feels intuitive to you (the creator who's played it 500 times) will confuse fresh eyes. You can't evaluate your own game objectively—you're too close to it.

## The Golden Rules

1. **Shut up and watch.** Don't explain. Don't help. Don't justify.
2. **Players lie (unintentionally).** What they SAY vs. what they DO often conflicts.
3. **One goal per session.** "Is the tutorial clear?" not "Is everything good?"
4. **New players only.** Someone who's played before can't give first-impression feedback.

## What to Observe

Before asking questions, just watch:

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| Leaning forward, focused | Engaged, possibly in flow |
| Leaning back, arms crossed | Disengaged, frustrated, or bored |
| Clicking/tapping randomly | Lost, doesn't know what to do |
| Long pauses | Confused or thinking (context matters) |
| Laughing/smiling | Enjoying themselves |
| Sighing/groaning | Frustrated |
| Checking phone | Game lost their attention |

**Time distortion test**: After they play, ask how long they think they played. If it felt shorter than actual time, they were having fun. If it felt longer, they weren't.

## The 5 Core Questions

Based on Schell Games' playtesting framework:

1. **What did you enjoy most?**
   - Gets them talking positively first, more likely to be honest after

2. **What frustrated you or felt confusing?**
   - Direct question about problems—don't ask "did you like it?"

3. **What would you do differently if you played again?**
   - Reveals their understanding (or misunderstanding) of your systems

4. **If you had a magic wand and could change ONE thing, what would it be?**
   - Concrete framing gets better answers than "what should we change?"

5. **Would you play this again? Why or why not?**
   - The real test—polite "yes" vs. enthusiastic "yes" tells you a lot

## Questions to Avoid

- "Did you have fun?" (They'll say yes to be nice)
- "Do you like the graphics?" (Leading question)
- "Did you understand [specific thing]?" (Leading, and they'll say yes)
- "What do you think we should add?" (Not their job to design your game)

## Playtesting Phases

### Prototype Stage
- **Goal**: Is the core loop fun?
- **Testers**: Friends/family is fine
- **What to show**: Greyboxed, ugly, functional
- **Key question**: "Would you play more of this?"

### Alpha Stage
- **Goal**: Is progression/pacing working?
- **Testers**: Target audience, not friends
- **What to show**: Core systems complete, rough edges okay
- **Key question**: "What made you want to stop?"

### Beta Stage
- **Goal**: Polish, bugs, edge cases
- **Testers**: As close to real players as possible
- **What to show**: Near-complete experience
- **Key question**: "What felt unfinished?"

## Where to Find Testers

### Free Options
- **r/playmygame** - Reddit community for exactly this
- **r/RobloxGameDev** - Roblox-specific feedback
- **Roblox DevForum** - Post in Creations Feedback
- **Discord servers** - Game dev communities, Roblox communities
- **Friends of friends** - Not YOUR friends, but people who don't know you

### Roblox-Specific
- **Private servers** - Invite testers to controlled environment
- **Soft launch** - Limited release to specific regions
- **Analytics** - Roblox's built-in analytics show where players drop off

## What to Do With Feedback

1. **Look for patterns.** One person's opinion is noise. Five people saying the same thing is signal.
2. **Trust behavior over words.** If they SAY it's fine but LOOK frustrated, it's not fine.
3. **Solutions are your job.** Players are good at identifying problems, bad at solving them.
4. **Not all feedback is equal.** Feedback from your target audience matters more than feedback from people who wouldn't play your genre anyway.

## The Feedback Trap

Don't change everything after every playtest. You'll end up chasing contradictory opinions and lose your vision.

**Process:**
1. Collect feedback from multiple testers
2. Identify patterns (3+ people mentioning same issue)
3. Prioritize by impact on core loop
4. Make changes
5. Test again with NEW testers
