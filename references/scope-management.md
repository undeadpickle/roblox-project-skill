# Scope Management for Roblox Projects

## The Problem

Over 70% of indie games fail due to scope being too large. Not lack of skill, not bad ideas—just biting off more than can be chewed.

Scope creep is insidious. It doesn't announce itself. It whispers "wouldn't it be cool if..." and before you know it, your simple obby has a crafting system, a pet collection, a housing feature, and you've been "working on it" for two years.

## The Cure: Ruthless Prioritization

### MoSCoW Method

Categorize every feature before building:

| Category | Definition | Rule |
|----------|------------|------|
| **Must Have** | Game literally doesn't work without it | Build first, no exceptions |
| **Should Have** | Significantly improves the experience | Build if Must Haves are solid |
| **Could Have** | Nice to have, players would appreciate | Only if everything else is done |
| **Won't Have** | Cool ideas for a future version | Write down, then forget about |

**The trap**: Everything feels like a Must Have when you're excited. It's not. Strip it down until it hurts, then strip it down more.

### The "One Mechanic" Test

Can you describe your game with ONE core mechanic?

- ✅ "You jump between platforms"
- ✅ "You shoot zombies"  
- ✅ "You collect items to sell"
- ❌ "You jump between platforms while collecting items to craft weapons to fight zombies while managing a base"

If you need "while" or "and" more than once, you're overscoped.

## Feature Creep Warning Signs

You're in trouble if:

- [ ] You keep adding features but never finishing any
- [ ] The feature list has grown since you started
- [ ] You're excited about the NEW thing, bored of the CURRENT thing
- [ ] "Just one more feature and it'll be ready"
- [ ] You can't play the core loop because it's "not ready yet"
- [ ] You're building systems for imaginary future content

## The "Would Anyone Miss It?" Test

For any feature you're considering, ask:

1. If I shipped without this, would players notice?
2. If they noticed, would they care?
3. If they cared, would they stop playing?

If you can't answer "yes" to all three, it's not a Must Have.

## Healthy Scope Patterns

### Vertical Slice First
Build ONE complete slice of the game at near-final quality:
- One level/area fully playable
- Core loop working end-to-end
- Basic UI functional
- One monetization path implemented

This proves the game works before you scale horizontally.

### Expand, Don't Add
When your vertical slice works, add MORE of the same:
- More levels (not new mechanics)
- More enemies (not new systems)
- More items (not new item types)

Adding variety ≠ adding complexity.

### The "Cut List"
Keep a running list of things you've cut. Review it when you're feeling feature-hungry. Seeing all the things you decided NOT to do helps maintain discipline.

## Scope Recovery

Already overscoped? Here's how to recover:

1. **Stop adding.** Seriously. Nothing new until something ships.
2. **List everything** you've built and everything you planned.
3. **Find the core loop.** What's the one thing players actually do?
4. **Cut everything** that doesn't directly serve the core loop.
5. **Ship something.** A small finished game > a massive unfinished one.

## The Kill Decision

Sometimes the right call is to stop working on a project. Signs it's time:

- The core loop isn't fun after multiple iterations
- You dread opening the project
- The idea excited you more than the execution
- Another idea has completely captured your interest

Killing a project isn't failure. It's learning. Abandoning it slowly over years while pretending you'll "get back to it" is the failure.

## Quick Reference

**Before building any feature:**
1. Which pillar does it serve?
2. Is it Must/Should/Could/Won't?
3. Would players miss it if it wasn't there?

**Weekly check-in:**
- Is my feature list longer or shorter than last week?
- Can I play the core loop right now?
- What have I finished (not started) this week?
